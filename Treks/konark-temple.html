			<h2>Konark Sun Temple: A Timeless Tribute to the Sun God</h2> 
			<h3>A UNESCO World Heritage Site</h3>
			<p>
				The Konark Sun Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stands as a magnificent testament to the
				architectural and artistic prowess of ancient India. Located in the state of Odisha, this 13th-century
				temple is dedicated to the Sun God, Surya, and is renowned for its intricate carvings, colossal
				structure, and unique chariot-shaped design.
			</p>

			<h3>Architectural Marvel</h3>
			<p>
				The temple is designed as a colossal chariot with twelve pairs of intricately carved stone wheels and
				seven horses pulling it. Each wheel represents a month of the year, and the horses symbolize the seven
				days of the week. The temple's walls are adorned with sculptures depicting celestial beings, scenes from
				daily life, and erotic figures, showcasing the rich cultural heritage of the time.
			</p>

			<h3>Symbolism and Spiritual Significance</h3>
			<p>
				The Konark Sun Temple is not just an architectural wonder but also a place of immense spiritual
				significance. The temple's alignment with the sun's rays during the equinoxes adds to its mystique. The
				intricate carvings narrate stories from Hindu mythology and depict the cycle of life and death, making
				it a pilgrimage site for devotees and a fascinating destination for history enthusiasts.
			</p>

			<h3>Preservation and Restoration</h3>
			<p>
				Although the temple is partially in ruins, efforts have been made to preserve and restore its grandeur.
				The Archaeological Survey of India has undertaken extensive conservation work to protect the temple from
				further damage and ensure its legacy endures for generations to come.
