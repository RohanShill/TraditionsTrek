			<h2>Jagannath Temple Ranchi</h2>
			<p>The Jagannath Temple in Ranchi, also known as the Pahari Mandir, is a significant Hindu pilgrimage site in Jharkhand.
			Perched atop a hill, this temple offers not only a place of worship but also a scenic view of the city of Ranchi. Built
			in 1691 by King Thakur Ani Nath Shahdeo, the temple is a testament to the architectural prowess of its time, reminiscent
			of the famous Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha.

			Dedicated to Lord Jagannath, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the temple also houses idols of Balabhadra and Subhadra, the
			siblings of Lord Jagannath. Every year, during the Rath Yatra festival, the temple becomes a hub of spiritual activity,
			drawing thousands of devotees from all over the region. This festival, marked by the ceremonial procession of the
			deities on chariots, symbolizes the journey of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra from their temple to their
			garden palace.

			The temple is accessible by a flight of over 400 steps, providing an invigorating trek for pilgrims. The climb is
			rewarded with a panoramic view of Ranchi, which is especially mesmerizing at sunrise and sunset. The serene ambiance and
			the picturesque surroundings make the journey to the temple a soul-refreshing experience.

			Besides its spiritual significance, the Jagannath Temple is an architectural marvel with its intricate carvings and the
			vibrant colors of the deities. It stands as a symbol of faith, devotion, and the rich cultural heritage of the region,
			making it a must-visit for both devotees and tourists exploring the spiritual landscape of Jharkhand..</p>
