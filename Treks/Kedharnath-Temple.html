			<h2>Kedharnath Temple</h2>

				Kedarnath Temple, located in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, is one of the most sacred Hindu shrines dedicated to
				Lord Shiva. Nestled in the majestic Garhwal Himalayas near the Mandakini River, this temple is part of the Chota
				Char Dham pilgrimage circuit and holds immense spiritual significance. The temple is believed to have been
				originally constructed by the Pandavas and later renovated by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century, showcasing a
				blend of ancient and medieval architectural styles.
			</p>
			<p>
				The temple stands at an altitude of 3,583 meters (11,755 feet) above sea level, making it one of the highest temples
				in the country. The main deity of Kedarnath is a naturally formed conical rock, representing Lord Shiva in his
				Sadashiva form. The sanctum sanctorum houses this sacred lingam, which is worshipped by thousands of devotees who
				undertake the challenging journey to seek blessings. The temple's architecture is characterized by its stone
				construction, intricate carvings, and a large assembly hall that houses images of various deities and mythological
				scenes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The journey to Kedarnath Temple is both arduous and awe-inspiring. Pilgrims typically start from Gaurikund and
				undertake a steep 16-kilometer trek through picturesque landscapes, including dense forests, gushing rivers, and
				snow-capped mountains. This trek, though physically demanding, is considered a spiritually enriching experience,
				with devotees chanting hymns and prayers throughout the journey. During the winter months, due to heavy snowfall,
				the temple remains closed, and the deity is shifted to Ukhimath for worship.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kedarnath Temple is not just a site of religious worship but also a symbol of resilience and faith. The devastating
				floods of 2013 severely impacted the region, but the temple miraculously withstood the natural calamity, reinforcing
				the belief in divine protection. The temple and the surrounding town have since been rebuilt, continuing to draw
				pilgrims and tourists from around the world. Visiting Kedarnath Temple offers a profound spiritual experience,
				coupled with the breathtaking beauty of the Himalayan landscape, making it a must-visit destination for those
				seeking solace and divine blessings.
